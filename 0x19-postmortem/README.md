Issue Summary: <br />

Duration: March 24, 2017, 07:32 AM - March 24, 2017, 08:15 AM (UTC) <br />
Impact: Internal Server Error (HTTP 500) was encountered, rendering the web service inaccessible to users during the outage. <br />
Root Cause: Typo mistake in the PHP configuration file causing a misdirected require_once function call. <br />
Timeline:

07:32 AM (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring as HTTP 500 error responses were observed.<br />
07:35 AM: Engineering team alerted of the issue.<br />
07:40 AM: Initial investigation focused on reviewing Apache server logs for error details.<br />
07:50 AM: Misleading assumption made about a potential server misconfiguration.<br />
08:00 AM: Issue escalated to PHP developers for deeper code inspection.<br />
08:05 AM: PHP configuration files reviewed, identifying a typo in the filename specified in a require_once function call.<br />
08:10 AM: Typo corrected in the PHP configuration file.<br />
08:15 AM: Service restored to normal operation.<br />
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: Typo mistake in the PHP configuration file led to an incorrect filename being referenced in the require_once function call.
Resolution: Typo in the PHP configuration file corrected, ensuring the correct filename (class-wp-locale.php) is referenced in the require_once function call.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement a thorough code review process to catch and correct syntax errors and typos before deployment.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide more detailed error reporting, including file path references in PHP error logs.
Tasks:
Conduct comprehensive review of PHP configuration files for potential syntax errors and typos.
Establish automated testing procedures to validate PHP configuration file integrity before deployment.
Develop documentation and training materials to educate team members on proper file referencing practices to prevent similar issues in the future.
